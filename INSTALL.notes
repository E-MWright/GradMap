1a) Head over to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and grab the latest
   appropriate version of anaconda and install this on your computer
   
   For version 4.2.0 (dec 2016) the links are:

   https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
   https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
   https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe

   For Linux you install this  by running the .sh file through bash,
   for Mac and Win they are selfguiding graphical installs.
