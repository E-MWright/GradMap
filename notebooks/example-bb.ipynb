    "\n",
    "Stellar spectral types are dependent on two things: the overall shape of the spectrum, and the\n",
    "spectral absorption lines superimposed on it, both of which are in part determined by surface\n",
    "temperature. Different absorption lines are caused by particular atoms and molecules, which are\n",
    "excited by the star's heat to cause different amounts of absorption. In some cases, a star's surface\n",
    "temperature even dictates whether or not specific ions and molecules can exist in the star's\n",
    "atmosphere. For example, titanium oxide (TiO) will only form at lower temperatures, but extremely\n",

    "however, we will focus on the other component of spectroscopy: the overall shape of a spectrum.\n",

    "range from 10 -10 m to 1.5x10 -6 m. Include as many points as needed for a smooth plot.\n",
    "3. Using this array and your function, plot the spectrum of an A0 star. Before moving on, make\n",
    "sure the function and script work . Does the plot look like what you’d expect?\n",
    "4. Plot the spectra of the Sun and an M0 star on the same figure. Format the plot so that each\n",
    "star is represented with a different color and line style. Include axis labels, a title, and a\n",
    "legend.\n",
    "5. Now that you’ve looked at purely theoretical spectra, let’s see how it compares to a real\n",
    "spectrum. Read in and plot the standard spectrum for a B0 star in a new figure.\n",
    "6. Generate a spectrum for a star of the same temperature from your Planck function using the\n",
    "range of wavelengths given from the standard spectra data. After normalizing this array (to\n",
    "normalize is to divide each point by the maximum point), plot it over the real spectrum. Add\n",

    "match the unknown spectrum best. What characteristics do you look for in a match?\n",

    "5. Now calculate the sum of squares of the residuals of the two standards, keeping two decimal\n",
