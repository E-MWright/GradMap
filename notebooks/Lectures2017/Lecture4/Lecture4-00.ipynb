    "The galaxy NGC 6503 is not a very bright or massive or big galaxy as they come, however it is relatively isolated in space and thus not very perturbed by nearby companions. This simplifies studying the gasflow in the galaxy in order to say something sensible about the dark matter contents in a galaxy. Otherwise one could be worried about companions perturbing the dynamics of the gas or stars in this galaxy.\n",
