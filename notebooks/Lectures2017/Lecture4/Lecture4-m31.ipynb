    "# Dark Matter in M31  .. in 1970 (Rubin & Ford)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tribute to [Vera Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin)'s work here is a notebook discussing one of her well known papers on the topic of dark matter.  During the Greenbank observing we un-covered rotation in our galaxy, and how we could find out that there is dark matter in the Milky Way. But now we will uncover that our nearest neighbor galaxy,the Andromeda Galaxy (a.k.a. **M31**), seems to have dark matter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although [Fritz Zwicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky), in 1933 already, had indications that things did not add up, and he coined the term *dunkle Materie* (*Dark Matter* in German, he is from Swiss origin), it took another 20+ years before the astronomical community realized he was right.  Zwicky's work was based on the motions of galaxies in clusters, but it was the work of Roberts, Rubin, Bosma and many others that solidified that in galaxies themselves there was an equal problem of \"missing matter\", which we now call Dark Matter, after Zwicky.\n",
