    "Welcome to you projectile motion challenge problem! Here you'll write code that will plot the trajectory of a projectile in ideal conditions, with the standard assumptions of no air resistance and constant gravitational acceleration. You'll use the path-length function you created earlier to compare the total distance traveled in the air by the projectile for different launch angles and launch velocities.\n",

It is launched from position (0,0) with launch angle $\\theta$ above the positive $x$ axis, launch speed $v_0$, and gravitational acceleration $g$ in the $-y$ direction. We'll use a time coordinate $t$ to specify the time since launch.\n",
