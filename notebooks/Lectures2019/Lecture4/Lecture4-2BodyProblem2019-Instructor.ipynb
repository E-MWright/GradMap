    "Many problems in statistical physics and astrophysics require solving problems consisting of many particles at once (sometimes on the order of thousands or more!) This can't be done by the traditional pen and paper techniques you would encounter in a physics class. Instead, we must implement numerical solutions to these problems. \n",

    "Today, you will create your own numerical simulation for a simple problem is that solvable by pen and paper already, the 2 body problem in 2D. In this problem, we will describe the motion between two particles that share a force between them (such as Gravity). We'll design the simulation from an astronomer's mindset with astronomical units in mind. This simulation will be used to confirm the general motion of the earth around the Sun, and later will be used to predict the motion between two stars within relatively close range.\n",
