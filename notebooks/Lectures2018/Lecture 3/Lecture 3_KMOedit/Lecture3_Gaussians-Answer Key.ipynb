    "You just learned a little about what a Gaussian distribution looks like. As a reminder, a Gaussian curve is sometimes called a bell curve because the shape looks like a bell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To review, the equation for the Gaussian curve is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{\\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution, where $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma=1$, is selected for by calling `np.random.randn()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably wondering why Gaussian, a.k.a. normal, distributions are so important. The reason is that the distributions of many things follow a normal distribution -- such as the heights of people, manufactured parts, blood pressure readings, and error measurements -- making it important to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are specific metrics that describe a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The mean, median, and mode of a Gaussian distribution are all the same.\n",
    "2) There is symmetry about the mean, as in 50% of the values fall to the right of the mean and the other 50% fall to the left.\n",
    "3) A certain amount of data falls within integer multiples of the standard deviation, as shown below.\n",

    "Does the lifetimes data we plotted earlier hold up to these three criteria? Let's find out.\n",
