    "# Welcome to your first numeric simulation! The 2 Body Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in statsical physics and astrophysics requiring solving problems consisting of many particles at once (sometimes on the order of thousands or more!). This can't be done my traditional pen and paper techniques you are all learning in your physics classes. Instead, we must impliment numeric solutions to these problems. This idea one of the core ideas behind numeric simulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you will create your first of many numeric simulation for a simple problem is that solvable by pen and paper already, the 2 body problem in 2D. In this problem, we will describe the motion between two particles that share a force between them (such as Gravity). We'll design the simulation from an astronomer's mindset with their astronomical units in mind. This simulation will be used to confirm the general motion of the earth around the Sun, and later will be used to predict the motion between two stars within relatively close range.\n",
