    "In this problem, we want to find the velocity and position as a function of time of a simple harmonic oscillator.  A common example of a harmonic oscillator is a weight (with a mass $m$) that has been attached to the end of a spring with some resistance to it.  If you pull the weight away from the resting position, there is a restoring force that tries to pull the spring back to where it was (we pull, the spring pulls back).\n",

    "Mathematically, if we let the resting position be $x = 0$, then the restoring force is equal to\n",

    "$F = -kx$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is known as the spring constant, which simply describes how powerful the spring is (i.e. how stiff it is). If $k$ is large, the string is more stiff, if $k$ is small, it's easier to pull.\n",

    "\n",
    "$a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$ and $v = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say at some sample time $t$, the weight will be moving at some velocity $v$ and will be at position $x$.  What will be it's position and velocity be at some small time later ($t+\\Delta t$)?\n",
